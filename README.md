# Hackathon Starter Kit

This repository contains all the resources, sample files, and public test scripts for participants in the hackathon.

## Structure

- `public-tests/` — Public k6/JMeter scripts for self-checking
- `api-spec/` — API documentation/specification
- `assets/` — Logos, images, and sample data
- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` — Sample containerization files

## Public vs. Hidden Tests

- Public tests are provided for self-checking and basic validation.
- Additional hidden tests will be used by organizers for final judging (e.g., high load, edge cases, security, long-duration tests).

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo.
2. Review the API spec and requirements.
3. Use the public test scripts to validate your project before submission.
4. Follow the README instructions for building and running your app in Docker.
